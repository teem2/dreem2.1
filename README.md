To start dreemGL type

node server.js

The current devwork on the editor and UI kit

To try livecoding a shader open this:

http://127.0.0.1:2000/imagesearch
and open compositions/imagesearch/myview.js in your editor and start typing away and saving, reload should be live.

As the server starts, it also shows other local IP's its listening on (for trying it on your phone)
Open http://<mylocalip>:2000/imagesearch on your mobile device to livecode shaders from your laptop to your phone.

Have fun!
